*PE01*

Project Description

This project was developed for the PE01 Programming Exercise. The goal was to build a simple machine learning application using the Iris dataset and deploy it as a Flask API.

The application trains a classification model and exposes an API endpoint that receives flower measurements and returns both the predicted class label and the corresponding species name.

Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to demonstrate basic concepts of:

Machine learning model training

Model persistence

API development with Flask

JSON-based prediction responses

Output

The API returns a JSON response containing:

A numeric prediction label

A human-readable species name
